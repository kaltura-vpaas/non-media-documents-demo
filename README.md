## Attachment Asset

An [attachmentAsset](https://developer.kaltura.com/console/service/attachmentAsset) is an object that is associated with a given [mediaEntry](https://developer.kaltura.com/console/service/media)

In the [KMC](https://kmc.kaltura.com/index.php/kmcng/content/entries/list) attachmentAssets are viewable in the "Related Files" tab of "Entries" The Kaltura system uses attachmentAssets for items like storing captions for a mediaEntry. The API also allows you to store your own files associated with a mediaEntry.

In the demo app, the first section handles attachmentAssets:

![attachmentExample](readme_assets/attachmentExample.png)

First, you will need to select an `id` from one of your entries at https://developer.kaltura.com/console/service/media/action/list

Then choose a file and submit the form. Control is handled by [index.js](https://github.com/kaltura-vpaas/non-media-documents-demo/blob/master/routes/index.js#L24) which passes the form's data to [attachmentAssetExample.js](https://github.com/kaltura-vpaas/non-media-documents-demo/blob/master/lib/attachmentAssetExample.js)

First an [attachmentAsset](https://developer.kaltura.com/console/service/attachmentAsset) is [created](https://github.com/kaltura-vpaas/non-media-documents-demo/blob/master/lib/attachmentAssetExample.js#L5)
